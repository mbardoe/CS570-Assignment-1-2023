# Assignment
# Finish creating a class that has a method called pose_question()
# The pose_question method should take no inputs and simply return a string.
# It should clearly ask the user for their name in some way and then return that string.
# You may want to investigate python's input function.
# For bonus credit see if you can turn their name into a nickname. Is there a way to
# algorithmically alter a name to make it a nickname? Even just in particular cases?

# Goals for this assignment:
# Show facility with objects and classes in python
# Part of the goal of this assignment is to only work on one file in this repository.
# Then make a Pull_Request to integrate your code into the repository.
