# CS570-Assignment-1

In this assignment multiple students work together to create an application. The students share a GitHub repository, and 
then submit their work using pull request. Finally, the work of the threesome is brought together in one application.

Student 1:

Start by making a branch named your_name/dev. Finish writing the GreetingMaker.py file. Instructions can be found 
in that file.
Commit your changes to your branch, and then make a pull request to main branch on GitHub. 


Student 2:

Start by making a branch named your_name/dev. Finish writing the QuestionAsker.py file. 
Instructions can be found in that file. Commit your changes to your branch, and then make a 
pull request to main branch on GitHub. 


Student 3:

Start by making a branch named your_name/dev. Finish writing the main.py file. Instructions can be found 
in that file. Commit your changes to your branch, and then make a 
pull request to main branch on GitHub. Once you have made, your changes and the other students in the group 
have made their pull requests. Accept all pull requests and see if your program works on the main branch.


When all three of your pieces are integrated together. You should be able to run main.py and see a program that asks
a user for their name and then constructs some kind of greeting with that name, and displays that greeting on the screen.
Like this:

```commandline
What is your name?
Matt
Hello, Matty. How are you today?
```

### Remember

You are only to work on one file. Your work will be integrated into the whole when you commit your changes.
